This folder is for debug / automatic updates

The version number follows these rules of conversion:
Normally it is major.minor.bugfix
And in the CurrentStableVersion file it is
mmmiibby
where m is major
i is minor
and b is bugfix
y is a 1 or 0 value that is 1 if the version is used as a beta. This is always a zero in currentStableVersion
